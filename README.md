DAC Piano

Problem Statement:
Design and implement a digital piano on a Tiva microcontroller using a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to produce musical notes. 
The system should generate audible tones corresponding to piano keys, and each key press should produce a specific frequency sound. 
The output from the DAC will drive a speaker or audio output device.
